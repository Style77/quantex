# Quantex

Powerful trading bot, based on ChatGPT sentiment analysis of news headlines.

## Motivation

The goal of this project is to create a trading bot that can make money on the stock market. The bot will be based on the sentiment analysis of news headlines. The sentiment analysis will be done by a [OpenAi's ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) model that has been trained on a large corpus of data. The bot will use the sentiment analysis to predict the stock market and make trades accordingly. It is inspired by paper released by Alejandro Lopez-Lira and Yuehua Tang from University of Florida on april 6th 2023, named ["Can ChatGPT Forecast Stock Price Movements? Return Predictability and Large Language Models"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.07619.pdf)
